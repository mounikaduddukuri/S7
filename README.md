Fix the network above:
1. change the code such that it uses GPU
2. change the architecture to C1C2C3C40 (basically 3 MPs)
3. total RF must be more than 44
4. one of the layers must use Depthwise Separable Convolution
5. one of the layers must use Dilated Convolution
6. use GAP (compulsory):- add FC after GAP to target #of classes (optional)
7. achieve 80% accuracy, as many epochs as you want. Total Params to be less than 1M. 
8. upload to Github
9. Attempt S7-Assignment Solution
