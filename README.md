Assignment 7
Run this [network](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qlewMtxcAJT6fIJdmMh8pSf2e-dh51Rw)  
Fix the network above:
1. change the code such that it uses GPU
2. change the architecture to C1C2C3C40 (basically 3 MPs)
3. total RF must be more than 44
4. one of the layers must use Depthwise Separable Convolution
5. one of the layers must use Dilated Convolution
6. use GAP (compulsory):- add FC after GAP to target #of classes (optional)
7. achieve 80% accuracy, as many epochs as you want. Total Params to be less than 1M. 
8. upload to Github
9. Attempt S7-Assignment Solution


```
S7
Targets:
1.setup model
2.Setup learning path 
3. Summarizing the model 
4. using relu 
5. using the Adam
Results:
1. weights , summaries,Trainable params and the accuracy is obtained 
Analysis:we can set the model stable and can also underfit by using hyper parametera tuning
